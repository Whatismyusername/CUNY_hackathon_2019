            <h1>Mission:</h1>
            <p>Manage the homeless crisis in NYC by decreasing strain on facilities that serve homeless people through the supply of publicly 
                available and accessible information that directs those in need to locations that can cater to their specific situations.</p>

            <h1>Why Support Us:</h1>
            <p>HomeMore offers the homeless a repository of information, but we need your help to develop it. By helping us, you connect with 
                other organizations which allows for mutual benefit as the homeless will be shifted from location to location depending on who 
                has sufficient resources to help. While we will not solve the  homeless crisis today, we will mitigate its effects and you can 
                join in this effort.</p>
